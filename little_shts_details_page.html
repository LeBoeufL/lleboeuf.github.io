      <div class="description">
        "Little Sh*ts" was a copper plate print that I made in my Intro to Printmaking course 
        under Johanna Paas.  The prompt for this project was "the old and the new".  I chose to
        approach this by etching a cat sitting near a sabertooth tiger skull 
        displayed on a shelf, possibly about to push it off the table.
