      <div class="description">
       "Fat Kids Foods" is a logo proposal that I designed in a client group- Clayton Hildebrant, Ava
       Zaraffano, Emma Corbett, and Sarah Piatek, for ART 335 under David Stairs. The client-- Drake Evans-- was a
       business student. His business was a food truck that sold gourmet worldwide cquisine.  Drake was a skilled chef, 
       who has won many awards for his kitchen skills, and has even met celebrity chefs.
