       This is a silly project, and I loved it.  This digital illsutration 
       is inspired by the show 'Bojack Horseman', a netflix original series.
       The style of the show is simplistic, unnaturalistic, and cartoonish with 
       relatively simple animation and flat colors.  I wanted to create a piece 
       to find my style with these characters, depicting them in almost 
       a completely opposite artstyle.  This is a show I personallly love very
       deeply, with an inspiring message that resounded deeply with me.
       This piece was specifically inspired by the episode 'Free Churro'.
