        “Bloom Wish’ was a website that I designed in a client group- Clayton Hildebrant, Ava
        Zaraffano, Emma Corbett, and Sarah Piatek, for ART 335 under David Stairs. The client was a
        business student, Grace Huynh. Her business was a paper/card company that was centered
        around using seed paper. They would print wedding advertisements, thank you cards, birthday
        cards, and even bouquets that could be planted. Their business centered legacy. I was charged
        with creating the website for the client.
