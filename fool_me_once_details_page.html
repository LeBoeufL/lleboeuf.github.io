      <h1>"Fool Me Once"</h1>
      <div class="date">April, 2024</div>
      <div class="description">
        This piece was a multi-print project, which featured a large sketch on 24 x 18 inch paper.
        The sketch was then simplified and made into a lithography print, with 5 editions in total. 
        This piece was impired by the unfortunate situation some individuals face when
        they are fooled by a person they trust.  The multiple prints were titled individually
        to express the frustration in the repeating patterns of toxic behavior.
