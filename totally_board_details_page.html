      <div class="description">
        ‘Totally Board’ was a brand that I created and developed for my ART 235 Logo and
        Identity class under my professor Clark Most III. This project’s goal was to advocate for teen
        and young adult fitness through healthy hobbies. I was challenged to experiment with
        advertisements that were easily taken-in while on the go.
